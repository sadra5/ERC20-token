# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Token design 
1) initial supply (send to owner)
2) max supply (capped)
3) make token burnable
4) create block reward to distribure new suppy to miners
5) make the the contract selfdestruct


Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
